I was talking about my previous blog in [my article about Jekyll and Github Pages]({% post_url 2014-12-13-reloading-this-blog-on-github-pages-with-jekyll %}), it has been archived today and will still be accessible at [archive-blog.securem.eu](http://archive-blog.securem.eu/).

I will still be talking about web development, new technologies, and network security here, and in English now. I often use my blog as a reminder for complex manipulations or settings, but I also love to share things I may find or reviews of things I may try. Maybe the next post will be talking about performances of DNS Tunnels ! ;)
