**TL;DR**: This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages, with a custom domain and over HTTPS. GitHub/Fastly
is serving it with a certificate generated by them.

## This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages

This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages, through Fastly (the CDN used by GitHub).

    $ host blog.securem.eu
    blog.securem.eu is an alias for mickaelbergem.github.io.
    mickaelbergem.github.io is an alias for sni.github.map.fastly.net.
    sni.github.map.fastly.net has address 151.101.17.147
    sni.github.map.fastly.net has IPv6 address 2a04:4e42:1d::403

We do have a custom domain ("blog.securem.eu"), ie not a \*.github.io one.

We are **not using CloudFlare**, which is commonly used to add HTTPS on top of a GitHub Pages website.

## GitHub Pages does not allow you to use HTTPS on custom domains

This is understandable as it would mean generating, storing and deploying a large number of
certificates for domains not owned by GitHub.

![GitHub does not allow HTTPS for custom domains](/assets/illustrations/github-custom-domain-https.png)

On the official documentation, it is clearly stated:

> You can enforce HTTPS to add a layer of encryption for traffic to your GitHub Pages site if it has a github.io domain.

Trying to access this website through HTTPS will raise an security error:

> The certificate presented is only valid for www.github.com, \*.github.com, github.com, \*.github.io, github.io, \*.githubusercontent.com, githubusercontent.com

As of today, people have used CloudFlare to bring HTTPS to their custom-domain GitHub-Pages-hosted websites, which is not the case here.

## WTF

So until now we have:

1. This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain, and no CloudFlare proxy.
2. GitHub Pages does not serve content over HTTPS for custom-domain websites

Then, we should get an error when trying to access it over HTTPS:

Oopsie?

So, yes, **this very website is served by GitHub Pages over HTTPS**. With a Let's Encrypt certificate generated a few days ago. Here is the certificate in the Certificate Transparency logs: [https://crt.sh/?id=399789700](https://crt.sh/?id=399789700).

**I did not generate this certificate**. GitHub (or someone else) did. And GitHub has the private key associated with the certificate, since they are serving the content over a trusted HTTPS connection.

## Conclusion?

I still do not explain how this happened. The best guess is that GitHub is preparing for automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation for custom domains, and tested it on a small (?) subset of the repositories.

One way to confirm this would be to check in the Certificate Transparency logs what other certificates have been generated around the same date and time, to see if other custom-domain GitHub Pages websites got new certificates. I didn't have time yet to investigate further.

Anyway, this looks weird since GitHub generated a certificate for a domain I own without notifying me or asking whether I was OK with it. I could have used [DNS CAA](https://blog.securem.eu/serverside/2017/07/02/dns-caa-what-why-and-how-this-new-pki-control-mechanism/), or alerts set on the Certificate Transparency logs to signal / block this "rogue" certificate.

Let me know if you think of any other possible explanation, or if you know something about it.
